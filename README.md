## Project Description
- The webpage is responsive and this was achieved by the use of media queries and flex box.
- There are two units of measurement for checking your BMI. The metric unit and the imperial unit.
- When the metric unit is selected, a new container appears with the height and weight input fields. In this unit, height is measured in 
    centimeters and weight in kilograms. This is the default unit of measurement.
- When the imperial unit is selected, a new container appears with four input fields; height in feet and inches and weight in stone and pounds.
- There is a validation that prevents users from inputting non-numeric values.
- After filling in all the input fields with valid values, a section with the weight suggesstion (health status; obese, underweight, overweight or healthy status) appears along with the actual BMI calculated.
- When a user switches from one unit of measurement to another, all the input fields are reset and there is a welcome message beneath the input fields.
